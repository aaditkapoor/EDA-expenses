# Conclusion according to the EDA
- We are able to successfully gather sufficient about my expenses.

- As you can see, the expensive area mean costs around 49 and the average spending at expensive area was about 50.
- As you can see, the expensive area costs around 1241 and I spent a lot on these areas.
